## What

the water pump and moisture sensors from http://makezine.com/18/garduino/

## Why

because I just went to europe for 2 months and came back and all my plants were dead :(

## Materials

- a couple 1N4004 diodes (I ordered 10)
- various resistors (I ordered a huge variety pack)
- relay (I ordered 6 G5LE-1 DC5 relays)
- underwater water pump (from a fish store)
- some tubing that fits on the pump if it doesnt come with any
- 5 gallon bucket full of water
- a plant
- a couple of iodized nails and some wire (and maybe plaster of paris too) to make moisture sensors
- arduino
