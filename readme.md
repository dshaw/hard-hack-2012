# Hard Hack 2012

__December 8thâ€“9th, 2012__<br>
760 Market Street Fifth Floor San Francisco, CA 94102

Voxer is hosting __Hard Hack__, a Node.js hardware hacking weekend on December 8-9, 2012 in downtown San Francisco, CA.

Hard Hack is an open collaboration for the Node.js community led by @dshaw.  Julian Gautier (@jagautier) of Voxer and creator of the Firmata module will be joined by notable Node.js hardware experts including Emily Rose (@nexxy), Elijah Insua (@tmpvar), and Jerry Sievert (@jerrysievert) in addition to Mikeal Rogers (@mikeal), Isaac Schlueter (@izaacs), Max Ogden (@maxogden), and @substack.

@Nexxy's going to kick off Hard Hack with an introduction of hardware hacking, then we will move into smaller groups to experiment with awesome tools and toys including arduino, raspberry pi, and #nodebots. There will likely be a #nodecopter or two that make an appearance.

This is not a hackathon. There will be no prizes other than the satisfaction of making something awesome! There will be very little in the way of talks. We're going to get together, collaborate and hack. This is more NodeConf SummerCamp than NodeConf. Sharing. Enjoying each other's company. Learning and exploring. And JavaScript. Lots of JavaScript.
